/* Nim: A 2-person game
 * Bill L 2021
 * with comments from Bill J
 *
 * At the game's start, there are one or more piles of matchsticks.
 * Players take turns.
 * The player whose turn it is must choose one pile and remove one or more
 * matchsticks from that pile.
 * The player who cannot remove a matchstick loses (i.e., the winner removes the
 * very last matchstick from the gameboard).
 *
 * We represent the piles of matches as an array of integers, where each
 * array element represents one pile, and the value at a given index represents
 * the number of matchsticks in that pile.
 *
 * This code is TERRIBLE from an organization perspective!
 * We will be discussing object-oriented programming in subsequent lectures;
 * The points of this example are to show how to decompose a high-level task
 * into discrete sub-tasks that can each be separately implemented,
 * and to exercise many of the Java language features
 * (variable declaration and assignment, operators, key classes,
 * input/output, loops and conditionals, etc.) that we have discussed so far.
